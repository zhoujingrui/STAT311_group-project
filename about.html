      <h2>Some of my favorite quotes</h2>
      <article>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "For me, heroes aren't just people with powerful Quirks like guys who
            can lift a fallen building or freeze a raging river. The real heroes
            are the people who do what is right, guide others to do the same,
            who take a stand, those who are willing to step up and be the change
            they're looking for."
          </p>
